## PRO TIPS

1. **Mix eras thoughtfully**: "Y2K nostalgia with modern minimalism" can work; "Brutalism + Claymorphism" probably won't

2. **Reference competitors**: "Similar to [competitor] but with [difference]" gives clear direction

3. **Use "inspired by" not "copy"**: AI builders interpret the essence, not pixel-perfect duplication

4. **Combine moods**: "Professional but not stuffy" or "Playful but trustworthy" guides the balance

5. **Reference non-web**: "Like a coffee table book" or "Like a movie poster" can convey unique layouts
