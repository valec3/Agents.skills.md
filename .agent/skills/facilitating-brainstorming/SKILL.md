# Facilitating Brainstorming

## When to use this skill
- Before creating new features or building components.
- When requirements are vague or high-level.
- When the user asks to "brainstorm" or "discuss an idea".

## Workflow

1.  **Understand Context**: Check project state, files, and docs.
2.  **Refine Idea**: Ask clarifying questions one at a time.
3.  **Explore Approaches**: Propose 2-3 options with trade-offs.
4.  **Present Design**: Draft the design in small chunks (200-300 words) and validate each.
5.  **Finalize**: Write the validated design to a document.

## Instructions

### 1. The Interaction Loop
- **One Question at a Time**: Never ask multiple questions in one turn.
- **Multiple Choice**: Offer options to make it easier for the user.
- **Incremental Validation**: Don't dump a huge spec; validate section by section.

### 2. Exploring Approaches
- Always propose 2-3 different technical approaches.
- Explain pros/cons for each.
- Recommend one and explain why.

### 3. Design Document
Once agreed, document the design:
- Target: `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`
- Include: Architecture, component details, data flow, error handling.
